# POC - InstantX - AGL (Automotive Grade Linux) - Vehicle to Cloud POC

## Objective

The objective of this POC is to demonstrate the capabilities and benefits of using Automotive Grade Linux (AGL) in combination with InstantX to enable seamless and efficient automotive use cases.

## Prerequisites

- Automotive Grade Linux (AGL) environment set up.
- InstantX Project running.
- Basic knowledge of Linux command line.
- Experience with containerization technologies (e.g., Docker).

## Setup Instructions

Step-by-step guide is documented in the [Setup Guide](./setup.md) with detailed steps to run the POC, including commands and expected outputs.

## Results

We were able to successfully integrate InstantX with AGL, enabling real-time data streaming and visualization of the first vehicle data Speed.Data. opening new possibilities for advanced automotive applications.

## Learnings / Observations

- We learn how AGL works in the connectivity stack and its interaction with the Cloud environments like InstantX Edge Solution.
- We identified potential areas for optimization and future enhancements in the integration process. e.g. improving the performance of the visualization dashboard and the simulator interface timing.
- We discover a large potential for leveraging real-time data in automotive use cases, particularly in areas like predictive maintenance and driver behavior analysis as part of the SDV (Software Defined Vehicle) evolution and Diagnostics.
